Pa Bai Turay and others used to come and play football and fishing in the wharf during this period they taught it fit that they should also claimed the land and stay, this was this the second early settler. A man by the named of Pa Njai was coming and doing finishing and farming but was not living in the community. Pa Bai Turay started banking and built the first pan bodi (CI Sheet house) and moque in 1982, 1985 to1991 , he also saw it as an opportunity to help those who were affected by the civil war in 1991 to 1992. Daniel Bassy who was living in the area close to the settlement was another early settler who claimed the land and built the second pan bodi house in 1993. During this period people were very much afraid of the community because of the evil practices that was going on in the community by then, children who use to swin in wharf by then will get circumsized  by the evil spirit without some circumsizing the child, this evil practices took place for a period of time until the settlement was vindicated from evil acts so the community was by a yeroba man who named it as Oloshoro which means (God with us)in the 90's. The late Sallay Samura and Isatu Bornoh who were living at Cole farm later came to settle in the community in 1994. After this period the community started growing gradually in 1995 to 2000 more people started coming into the community built more houses and involved in fishing, fish mongeling , wood and charcoal selling. In 2001 to 2004 the community started experiencing massive migration of people from the rural areas in the community with the help of early settlers people we're also able to grab and bank the land and started living in the community and they also started coming with their relatives.
